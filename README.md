# HPC Exercises

This are HPC Exercises that are part the undergraduate HPC course at Faculty of Computer and Information Science Ljubljana.

## Note

Folder `md5-HPC` holds three implementations of running the md5 algorithm on HPC. This part was a group project so only one of them belongs to me.

- `md5_mpi.c` belongs to me.
- `pow_OpenMP.c` belongs to [Luka](https://github.com/lukapantar-personal).
- `pow_pthread.c` belongs to [Sarah](https://github.com/sresix).
